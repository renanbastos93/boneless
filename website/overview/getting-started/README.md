# âœ¨ Getting started

## Installing dependencies

First, we need to install the binary of Service Weaver, Go Migrate, SQLC, and Boneless. Even so, I suggest you read the documentation of all of them on your official websites.



```sh
$ brew install golang-migrate
$ brew install sqlc
$ go install github.com/ServiceWeaver/weaver/cmd/weaver@latest
$ go install github.com/renanbastos93/boneless/cmd/boneless@latest
```
