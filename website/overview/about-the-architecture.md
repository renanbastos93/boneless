  Let's dive into the architecture used in Boneless. In this section, we will
  explore the intricacies and key details of the architecture that powers the
  project created by Boneless.

# ðŸ’¡ About the architecture

## What is the architecture used as the foundation for Boneless?

Boneless was inspired by Clean Architecture and offers templates that follow its core concepts. The templates provided by Boneless facilitate the creation of modular, maintainable, and testable codebases by promoting a clear separation of concerns and the independence of business logic from external dependencies. By using Boneless templates, developers can jumpstart their projects with a well-organized structure that aligns with Clean Architecture, enabling them to focus on implementing the domain-specific logic while adhering to best practices. Boneless empowers developers to build robust and scalable applications, leveraging the benefits of Clean Architecture for easier understanding, maintenance, and evolution over time.

Based on Service Weaver, which generates connections between components using gRPC, has greatly facilitated the development of our applications.

## Here is the current repository structure, reflecting the adopted architecture:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.go
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod
â”œâ”€â”€ go.sum
â”œâ”€â”€ internal
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ component.go
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ db
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ migrations
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ schema.sql
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ query.sql
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sqlc.yaml
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entity.go
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ store
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ db.go
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models.go
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ query.sql.go
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ weaver_gen.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bff
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ bff.go
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ router.go
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ weaver_gen.go
â””â”€â”€ weaver.toml
```

In this structure, we can observe the organization of directories and files in the repository. The `cmd` directory contains the `main.go` file, which is responsible for starting the application. The `go.mod` and `go.sum` files are used to manage project dependencies.

The `internal` the directory is where the main implementation of the application resides. Inside, we have the `app` directory, which contains components related to the application's domain, such as entities and business logic. The `db` directory is used to store files related to the database layer, such as migrations and SQL queries.

The `store` directory contains files related to data storage, such as the implementation of database access. The `bff` directory contains files related to the implementation of the Backend for the Frontend layer.

Lastly, the `weaver.toml` file is used to configure Service Weaver, which facilitates generating connections between application components using gRPC.

This directory and file structure reflects the adopted architecture in the repository, following the principles of Clean Architecture and facilitating the organization and maintenance of the application's source code.
