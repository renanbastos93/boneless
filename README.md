# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

## Why was the name 'Boneless' chosen for this CLI tool?

The choice of the name "Boneless" for this CLI tool draws inspiration from the historical figure Ivar the Boneless. Ivar the Boneless was a legendary Viking leader known for his strategic prowess, adaptability, and agility on the battlefield.

In a similar vein, the name "Boneless" for the CLI tool reflects these qualities in the context of software development. It symbolizes the tool's ability to navigate through complex tasks and challenges effortlessly, just as Ivar the Boneless maneuvered through battles with agility and cunning.

By associating the CLI tool with Ivar the Boneless, the name not only captures the spirit of adaptability and flexibility but also adds a touch of historical significance to the tool's identity.

In summary, the name "Boneless" pays homage to Ivar the Boneless and serves as a metaphor for the CLI tool's ability to conquer development obstacles with ease and grace.

## Which are the tools used behind the Boneless?

1. **Service Weaver**: Service Weaver is a tool that facilitates the creation and management of microservices. It helps in defining service boundaries, handling service discovery, and managing communication between microservices.
2. **go-migrate**: go-migrate is a database migration tool for Go applications. It allows developers to manage database schema changes and versioning in a structured and automated manner, ensuring smooth database migrations across different environments.
3. **SQLC**: SQLC is a tool that generates type-safe Go code based on SQL queries. It helps in writing database code by automating the process of generating Go code from SQL queries, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing type safety.
4. **Fiber**: Fiber is a fast and efficient web framework for Go. It provides a lightweight and easy-to-use foundation for building web applications. Fiber offers features like routing, middleware support, and performance optimizations, making it a popular choice for developing high-performance web services.

These tools, when used alongside Boneless, contribute to various aspects of the development process. Service Weaver aids in managing microservices, go-migrate simplifies database migrations, SQLC enhances database code generation, and Fiber provides a robust framework for building web applications. Together, they enhance the functionality and development experience of Boneless.
